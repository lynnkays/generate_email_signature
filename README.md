# Generate Commercial Email Signatures 
This is a single page that will take in an employee's data and then generate an HTML signature that they can copy and paste into their signature line. 

This was originally developed for J.P. Weigand & Sons Commercial Associates and Support Staff so that no script or manipulation of code would be involved in creating future signatures. Designations for Commercial Associates as well as multiple titles for assistants was all acounted for and implemented in this project.
